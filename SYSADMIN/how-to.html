	<h4><b>How to setup a media-based aquaponics system</b></h4>
	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header">
		    <b>Step 1</b>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
			<h5 class="card-title">Find a location</h5>
		    <p class="card-text">Before you begin building, you need to decide on a location for your aquaponics system. If you plan to use your aquaponics system to grow and sell fresh produce, you will need a larger system and more space. An aquaponics system may be located indoors, outdoors or in a greenhouse. Consider the climate in your area and your surroundings when deciding on a location.
			</p>
			<p class="card-text">If you live in an urban high rise, you can set the system up indoors, with artificial or window lighting. If you live in an area with a suitable climate, you can grow aquaponics produce outdoors in a flat, sunny location all year round. However, If you have cold winters, you may need to move your system indoors or put it in a greenhouse.</p>
			<p class="card-text">Aquaponics systems need monitoring, so it is a good idea to install them nearby and not in the farthest corner of your property. Unless you are using solar power, you need electricity nearby to run the pump and a water source for filling and occasionally topping up the tank.</p>
		</div>
	</div><br>
	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header">
		    <b>Step 2</b>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
			<h5 class="card-title">Setup your tank</h5>
		    <p class="card-text">The size of your tank will depend on the type of fish you will keep. Many people use large opaque barrels or square bins recycled from the food industry. Place the tank in the location you have chosen. If you use a barrel, you need to cut the top open to allow for oxidation and build a stand to prevent it from rolling over.
			</p>
		</div>
	</div><br>
	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header">
		    <b>Step 3</b>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
			<h5 class="card-title">Create your growing bed</h5>
		    <p class="card-text">A growing bed is a waterproof container of some sort holding the soilless medium that supports the plants. You can install your growing bed, sometimes called a flood table, above or alongside the fish tank. You can purchase ready-made growing bed containers, use large heavy-duty plastic trays or adapt wooden pallet crates.
			</p>
			<p class="card-text">However, building shallow wooden grow beds six to ten inches ( 15 to 25 cm) deep, similar to raised beds, is a simple and cost-effective solution. When your boxes are complete, they need to be lined with a pond liner and mounted on a stand that can withstand their weight when full of media and water.</p>
			<p class="card-text">It is important to remember to mount the beds at an angle of around five degrees, not flat. Enough to allow the water to flow through the media bed and back into the fish tank. You also need to make a hole in the lower end of the growing bed for the PVC pipe to take the water back to the fish tank.
			</p>
			<p class="card-text">Once mounted, fill the grow bed with your choice of growing medium. Perlite is light making it easier to elevate the grow beds, while gravel can be heavy but is inexpensive. Clay pebbles are pH neutral, hold moisture well and have a large surface area for the bacteria, making them a popular choice. </p>
		</div>
	</div><br>
	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header">
		    <b>Step 4</b>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
			<h5 class="card-title">Fit the components</h5>
		    <p class="card-text">You will need a pump, piping and plumbing fittings to get the water from your fish tank to the grow bed and back again. Place the pump at the bottom of the fish tank to pump water up to the high end of the growing bed. Using a T-fitting with a cross pipe the width of the grow bed at the end of the pump hose is a good idea.
			</p>
			<p class="card-text">Make holes in the cross pipe to distribute the water evenly across the width of the grow bed. You can use a timer to switch the pump on and off and control how much water goes into the grow beds. How often you flood the bed depends on the requirements of the plants you are growing.</p>
		</div>
	</div><br>
	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header">
		    <b>Step 5</b>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
			<h5 class="card-title">Test your aquaponics system.</h5>
		    <p class="card-text">Once you have installed all the components, it is time to test the system. Fill the tank with pond or rainwater. If you use tap water, you will need to leave it for at least two weeks before adding any fish to allow time for natural bacteria to build up.
			</p>
			<p class="card-text">Then switch on the pump and circulate the water checking all your piping and joints for leaks. The water should be pumped up to the grow bed, travel through the bed, and drain back into the tank.</p>
			<p class="card-text"></p>
		</div>
	</div><br>
	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header">
		    <b>Step 6</b>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
			<h5 class="card-title">Add the Fish</h5>
		    <p class="card-text">Now that your system is set up and tested, you can add your fish. A well-balanced aquaponics system can support a pound (0.45kg) of fish per gallon (3.78 liters) of water. However, when starting, use one fish for every 10 gallons (37.8 liters) of water, giving the fish space and ensuring the system does not fall out of balance. You can always add more fish later.
			</p>
			<p class="card-text">Make sure your water suits the requirements of the fish you have chosen, and add your fingerlings. It will take a while for your fingerlings to grow and produce enough waste to support plants. During this time, the water needs to circulate through the grow beds as the growing medium will filter the water whether plants are growing or not. </p>
		</div>
	</div><br>
	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header">
		    <b>Step 7</b>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
			<h5 class="card-title">Add the Plants</h5>
		    <p class="card-text">Using seedlings is an effective way to add plants to your growing bed as they have a head start. Remember to choose plants that suit your system’s capabilities in terms of size and nutrient production. It is a good idea to plant seeds in trays of potting soil when you introduce the fingerlings to your tank. By the time the seedlings are ready to transplant, your fish should be producing enough waste to support them.
			</p>
			<p class="card-text">When transplanting your seedlings from the soil, carefully rinse the dirt off the roots in a container of water before placing the plants gently into the growing medium, ensuring they are far enough down to reach the water and get nutrients. </p>
			<p class="card-text">Seedlings are not the only way to add plants to your aquaponics system. You can also sow some seeds directly in your grow beds, use starter plugs and even grow plants and herbs like basil and mint from cuttings.</p>
			<p class="card-text"></p>

	<div class="card">
		<div class="card-header">
		    <b>Step 8</b>
		</div>
		<div class="card-body">
			<h5 class="card-title">Maintain your system</h5>
		    <p class="card-text">Maintaining an aquaponics system is relatively simple. Feeding the fish is the most time-consuming aspect, and you can program automatic feeders to do this for you.
			</p>
			<p class="card-text">Overfeeding the fish is one of the most common mistakes, so only feed your fish as much as they can eat in around five to ten minutes, two to three times per day.</p>
			<p class="card-text">Every week or two, you’ll need to test the tank water. Check the pH, ammonia, nitrites and nitrate levels and make any necessary adjustments.</p>
